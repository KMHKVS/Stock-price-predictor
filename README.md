STOCK PRICE PREDICATION USING LINEAR REGRESSION Linear regression is a fundamental statistical technique used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It assumes that there exists a linear relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable. The goal of linear regression is to find the best-fitting straight line that describes the relationship between the variables. Linear regression makes several assumptions about the data, including linearity, independence of errors, constant variance of errors (homoscedasticity), and normality of errors. Linear regression is widely used in various fields, including statistics, economics, finance, engineering, and social sciences, for modeling and predicting relationships between variables. It serves as a foundation for more complex regression techniques and machine learning algorithms.
